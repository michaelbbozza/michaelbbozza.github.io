  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello. My name is Michael and I am a 21 year old male. I am from Farmingville, Long Island. I like to play pool (billiards), any type of sport (baseball, football, hockey, etc), and play a decent amount of video games to relax when I am not working. I thoroughly enjoy watching Hockey and football
      I enjoy programming to the fullest and love troubleshooting why code is not working. I am luckily employed at a business called New Oak, based out of Danbury, Connecticut.

  <p>
    Some other interests or hobbies of mine are programming and being on a computer. I excessively play around on a computer or go to programming websites, such as <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a> so that I may further my programming experience.
