  <h1>Got 99 Problems, Being a Tech Ain't One</h1>
  <h4>March 19,2015</h4>
  <p>
    The title may be undermining the actual amount of problems that techs face. Everyday, there are new tech issues arising, but as a tech/software engineer, I welcome any challenges or issues to come my way. One of the biggest problems that techs face in today's technology based society is the level of security and trust that the tech implements and customers feel. In the beginning of ATMs, people were afraid to use them due to possible identity theft, privacy invasion, etc. In a sense, the ATMs (really the banks) needed to build up their trust with people in order for people to use the ATM.

    As software and technology is constantly being improved, so does the security behind it. If a website is not secure, or if an app on your phone is invasive, people may not use that website or download the app. This puts some aspects of the technology industry in critical condition. In order for a website to be used by society or an app to be downloaded by millions of users, it needs to be secure and establish a sense of trust in the users. If the user cannot trust the website or app, they will not use it. This causes a serious problem in the tech world today, especially with hackers and identity thieves contriving new ways to obtain information.

    Cloud archiving has become a widely used method for users. It stores their information or pictures or whatever data they choose, on a remote server. Good idea, yes, if properly secured and maintained. Remember back in 2014 when Apple was hacked? All of the information on the iCloud server was viewed and released by someone that certainly should not have had access to that information. This hack propelled Apple to update its security on the server. Another example is Sony. Korea hacked into the Sony server and illegally released a movie for free on Youtube. ("The Interview" starring Seth Rogen and James Franco) Why is it that the server was so easily hacked by Korea? I could not tell you for sure (since I do not work at Sony), but I believe it is due to the security on the server. While Cloud archiving is a great thing because it keeps an amount of data off of your internal storage--giving you more room to download games, updates, etc, as well as makes data retrievable from your Cloud account--it does not seem fully secure. This causes a trust issue with users of Cloud archiving and remote servers. Apple and Sony are just two examples of servers being hacked. There are much more instances of these types of issues, constantly making users feel insecure and afraid that their privacy is being invaded or their information being taken and used.

    Unfortunately, there are not really too many solutions to help fix this from a user's standpoint (other than to have anti-virus and malware removers on their computers to help prevent hackers and viruses from obtaining their information). The rest falls on the company's themselves and their techs to implement a high enough security level that the servers cannot be hacked. Network security currently has a number of components, all designed to help prevent hacking or viruses or any other threats on the Internet. One possible solution is to upgrade and improve Network Security with new implementations that hackers have not come up with yet, as well as ones that they have created. They can implement stronger and more complex passwords, block unnecessary ports on the firewall, have multiple firewalls that are encrypted and require a key in order to get through; these are just some possible solutions. Another possible solution is to create a new encryption method that is unknown to hackers and ordinary techs/users. It should only be known by top techs and can only be accessed by these techs. This would help secure the servers, as well as induce trust in the user, knowing that their information and data is securely saved behind multiple firewalls and passwords. For non-tech people, I have a question. Would you feel safer behind 5 bodyguards or just 1? The firewall is "the bodyguard" of the server, computer--basically the Internet. The firewall is what blocks unauthorized users/data from entering the network. If this firewall is beefed up and has his buddies behind him, the network is much safer and much more secure.

    I hope you have enjoyed my little rant about network security and why trust is a big issue in the tech world. Please feel free to contact me with any feedback!
