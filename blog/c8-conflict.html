    Conflict. We've all faced it, some more than others. Conflict is something that cannot be avoided no matter how hard you try. However, there are ways to deal with conflict that are definitely better than others. If somebody wants to fight you, yes you can go ahead and fight with them, but that is not by any means the best solution. Whenever conflict arises, there are always a number of options available, some good, some bad, and some ugly. I have been in numerous conflicts (so please do not take me as an example of choosing the correct option). One of the conflicts was when my cousin was drinking (Tequila of course) and thought he was the big man on campus. Now, he is older than me, but not by much and is definitely not my superior. So for him to act the way he did, I wasn't having it. I tried taking the high road and telling him to stop, but after the 10th time, I started getting increasingly more frustrated. Being that my cousin was drinking, he blew it more out of proportion than it needed to be.

    We started tussling with each other. Starting off as a wrestling match and soon turned into a boxing match. After everything was all said and done, I was still angry at my cousin and felt some resentment. I tried talking him out of it and calmly telling him to stop, but he just wouldn't listen. My cousin and I normally get along (of course having arguments and disagreements from time to time), but this was the first legitimate fight we had gotten into. To this day, we don't argue or fight too much any more, since we are older and can see when we get the other to that point. I also know that 1- No more tequila for him (mainly any liquor in general) and 2- If he is drinking, don't talk to him. If I could go back to that day, I would have (tried to) stop him from drinking as much tequila as he did. I learned that my cousin can't hold his liquor too well, and that if someone is drunk, try not exacerbating the situation.

    Overall, try using other options as a resource when engaging in conflict. Not every resource is a good option, but conflict is inevitable. The only way to avoid conflict at that moment, is to try and take the least hostile route, but unfortunately, even that isn't guaranteed to get you out of it. Conflict can't be avoided, only suppressed.
