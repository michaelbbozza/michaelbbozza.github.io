  <h1>CSS Design</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, everyone. This blog will describe some of the features of using a CSS design, while explaining some of the best practices to use and differences between certain commands when using CSS. More specifically, I will be describing the difference between Margins, Borders, and Padding.
  </p>
  <h2>Margins</h2>
  <p>
    Margins. Very common word, but can be a little confusing when speaking in CSS terms. Allow me to clarify; Margins are comprised of the space outside of or in between elements, as well as any borders set on elements. Elements (as you may remember) refer to pretty much anything in the code, such as "<h1>" or "<p>". The "margin" command will change all four sides; whereas a more specific command like "margin-top", "margin-bottom", "margin-left", and "margin-right" specify which margin you would like to change.
  </p>
  <h2>Padding</h2>
  <p>
    You may be asking yourself "What does padding refer to?". Padding is the space around your content--such as your paragraph--separating the content from your margin or border edges. This can be used to center your paragraph. Same as the "margin" command, "padding" can be used as a shortcut to define all sides, or you may use "padding-top", "padding-bottom", "padding-left", and "padding-right" to specify where you would like to add space.
  </p>
  <h2>Borders</h2>
  <p>
    A border refers to the "box" around the padding and content, in between the margin and padding. Confused? No problem. I have included an image to help visualize what that means. (Thanks to W3 Schools.) <img src="http://www.w3schools.com/css/box-model.gif" /> <br>
    Borders can be set with the "border" command and depicting the size of the border, as well as color and design. Overall, the command would be:<br>
      "border: 2px solid red"<br>
    This creates a solid red border that is 2 pixels wide around your content.
