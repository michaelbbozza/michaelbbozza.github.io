    Class is now in session!--or at least in Ruby. Classes can be used to group together multiple methods, or "bundle" them together. I will show examples on this later on in this blog to help illustrate what I mean. Classes are used primarily to organize the data and make programming large amounts of code a lot simpler than constantly going through method by method and changing everything, sometimes repeating the same code. (Note: #1 Rule: D.R.Y. Don't Repeat Yourself) Methods with no Class implemented generally rely on themselves, rather than the whole block. Methods are great, until you want the method to work on multiple objects, causing you to write a million "if/else" or "case" or other loop statements. This is where using a Class can really be helpful. It can reduce the amount of loops and conditionals in your code, as well as work for multiple items, without retyping the same code.
