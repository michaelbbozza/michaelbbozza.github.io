  <h1>My Thinking Style and Phase 0 Reflection</h1>
  <h4>March , 2015</h4>
  <p>
    The biggest struggle for me during Phase 0 has been learning the Ruby programming language. For some reason, Ruby does not stick to my memory like the other languages have in the past. My thinking style is Concrete Sequential, meaning that I process information in an ordered, sequential, linear manner. I have a growth mindset, meaning that I enjoy challenges and am always up for a difficult task because I learn from failure instead of get discouraged. Of course like most people, I do not want to fail, but I do not get discouraged from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not believe that my inability to retain some of the Ruby language pertains to either my thinking style or mindset. I believe it pertains to the language itself. Ruby is a very particular and specific coding languages that will not run the code if one little period or quotation mark (or anything else) is in the wrong place. This causes long hours of scanning my code and rewriting the code in different ways to try and troubleshoot the issue.

    To help me with this issue, I plan on practicing the Ruby language and making sure that it is superglued into my brain, whether it requires rewriting my codes multiple times or reading a few articles or books about the language, I plan on making Ruby stick into my memory. I have enjoyed my first 3 weeks of Dev Bootcamp so far and eagerly look forward to the rest of my time here, learning new languages (like Ruby) and brushing up on the languages I already knew a little bit about (like JavaScript and HTML). I plan to use my thinking style (Concrete Sequential) to my advantage because programming is very sequential, meaning that if the first line is incorrect, the rest of the program is incorrect, so everything must be in an ordered, sequential format. I also plan on using my growth mindset to my advantage by taking on challenges that may be difficult to succedd in, but using the failure to my advantage and allowing me to learn and grow from my failure.
