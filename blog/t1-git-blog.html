        In programming, there is a technique that is commonly used. This technique is called "version control". Version control is very beneficial. I will touch more on the benefits in a later paragraph. Version control is very commonly used in Git and Subversion (SVN). I will explain how git helps keep track of your changes. Do you know what "GitHub" is? If not, I will explain what it is and why it should be used to help store your code.

        Let's start at the beginning--Version Control benefits. Version control is "controlling" the "version" of the code you are working on. Basically, it allows you to save previous versions of your code, just in case you make a mistake and crash the program. This is one of the benefits of version control. Your previous works are saved and changes are tracked, so that you may always refer back to them and see what was changed to either fix the program or cause it to crash. Another benefit of version control is that it allows you to view what other people change in the programming and when they did it. Let's say "Jim" was working on the project and changed something in the code that caused half of the inputs to not work, but he's out on vacation and you don't know what he changed. Version control allows you to view the recent changes and (pretty much) undo whatever Jim did.

        This is where git comes into play. Git uses version control constantly to help maintain the productiveness of your program. Git registers and stores the time and date of when data was changed, who changed it, and what they had changed. Git also allows you to work on a project with others simultaneously, without stepping on each other's toes. Git creates "branches" (like a tree) which allows different members to test out certain code and not step on each other's toes and overwrite each other's work.

        GitHub should, without a doubt, be used to store your code. "Why?", you may ask. That is a very good question. GitHub is a remote server that stores your code and allows you to make changes whenever you would like. This remote website makes it easier for developers in different states, countries, houses, etc, to all work on the same project without being in the same place. They each make their own "branch" and create the code they want to, and then submit it to the "Master" branch (let's compare this to the "trunk" of a tree. It is the main code that will be used) in which the person with the master privileges can look over and decide if it is a good addition to his program.

      I hope you have enjoyed this brief overview of some programming techniques. Tune in for more!
