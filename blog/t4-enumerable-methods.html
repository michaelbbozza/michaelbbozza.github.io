  <h1>Enumerable Method "Cycle"</h1>
  <h2>How "Cycle" Works and How to Use It</h2>

    <p>
      Cycle. Sounds simple, but when do you use it and how do you implement it? That is what I am here for. The method "cycle" is pretty much what you are most likely thinking it is--it <b>cycles</b> the information in the array (or list). For example: <br>
      <h3>array = ["Me", "Myself", "Irene"]</h3><br>
      <h3>This creates and defines the array and its values</h3><br>
      array.cycle<br>
      <h3>This continuously outputs "Me", "Myself", "Irene", "Me", "Myself", "Irene"...</h3><br>
      array.cycle(2)<br>
      <h3>This outputs the array <span id="text">TWO</span> times. The amount of outputs is specified in the parentheses.</h3><br>
      <br>
