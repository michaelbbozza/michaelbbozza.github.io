  <h1>RAM IT</h1>

    Computer memory is also known as RAM. RAM stands for "Random Access Memory". There is a lot of information on RAM and computer memory in general. RAM is used in a computer to take some of the load off of the CPU, or central processing unit. Think of a school teacher. They work all week and on friday they have 100 essays to grade. They may get a helper to assist them in grading to make the process go quicker, as well as not burn themselves out. This is similar to RAM and the CPU. The CPU would be the teacher and the RAM is the assistant. The RAM takes off some of the pressure and workload of the CPU, allowing the CPU to work better and last longer. As stated before, there is a lot of information on RAM and memory of a computer, but this article will give you a generally descriptive overview of the topic.

    The more RAM installed in your computer, the faster it will work and process information and data. The normal amount of RAM installed in a computer is 2 or 4 GB (Gigabytes). This is more than enough if the computer is not normally used or used for intense purposes (such as gaming). Depending on the amount of usage, you may want to upgrade your RAM if the computer is running slow (as well as check it for viruses, but that's another story). RAM is generally cheap and on most computers, you can upgrade from 2GB to 16GB as easily as taking out the original RAM stick by unclipping it from the motherboard. However, if you are not a technician, do not try it. Also, computers may be limited to the amount of RAM that is able to be installed. Be sure to check the specs (or specifications) of your computer before buying RAM and attempting to upgrade the computer.

    Without going too far into technical jargon and detail, RAM is considered an assistant to the CPU. RAM takes off some of the workload (more stores it for later viewing by the CPU) and allows the CPU to not get "frantic" and burn itself out. I hope this article has explained RAM and computer memory a little bit for you to show off to your friends. Please feel free to leave me any feedback!
