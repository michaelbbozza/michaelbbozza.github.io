  <h1>My Website Experience</h1>
  <h4>April 22, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    My experience for creating this website was overall very fun. I highly enjoyed using CSS to play around with the elements, as well as use my knowledge of HTML to program the website and critique the design. I enjoyed almost every part of designing this website. I got some good laughs when using CSS because of how the page came out, I learned some new tricks in both HTML and CSS on how to program in different ways, and applying this newly obtained knowledge was even more enjoyable. Creating and designing websites are definitely one of the most fun things to do in programming.

    Developing websites in surely a difficult task as you need to have everything in order and sized correctly to prevent just some of the potential issues that may arise. While knowing the code that is behind a website, it was still a lot of trial and error and viewing the website constantly to see if you agree with the layout/functionality of the site. This may require a lot of rewriting code (or at least a lot of moving code around in the correct order). Websites should be constantly updated and maintained properly to ensure the user's comfortability on your site.
