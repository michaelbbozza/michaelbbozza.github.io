      Hello! My name is Mike and this is my blog pertaining to Shereef's Fiewside Chat. This chat touches upon a lot of what Dev Bootcamp is about. To begin, my take on the DBC experience is that we will all we working continuously with programming languages, such as JS, Ruby, HTML, etc, for about 5 months straight, excluding the peer-pair programming and group projects. This experience intrigued me very much as I enjoy working with other people, whether it's to give them some assistance or working on a group project. I have worked a few customer service jobs so working (and let's be honest, working with the public is more of "dealing" with the public, especially in customer service) always intrigues me. I am an umpire in NY and constantly work with new partners all the time, as well as put up with coaches. The fact that I am now working with amazing people makes it a much better attraction for the bootcamp experience, as well as gives an individual the opportunity to succeed and converse with others that will understand what is being said. (Again, let's be honest, if you told some of your friends about what programming is and what we are doing, they would look at you like you had 10 heads.) The best way to learn is to be open to new information and accepting help from others if needed.

        My impression of DBC is that we will all be working together to further all of our skills and knowledge collectively. Since DBC has set us up with accounts and easy ways to access a fellow cohort member, it makes it much easier for us to converse and keep in touch with others that are aware of what we are talking about. This greatly helps in the learning process. I can talk to my cousin about programming until I'm blue in the face, but he just can't follow along. With DBC, we are always in touch with others that know some technical terms or have a little bit of programming experience, which we can talk to and bounce the ideas off of each other. I think that this is a great way of teaching a group and learning as a group, as well as learning how to engage with others.

        I am very excited to participate in this type of learning environment for many reasons. I get to interact with a group of new people that I would have never met before if Dev Bootcamp was not the type of experience that it is. I also would not have learned about the many different text editors or command line commands. This environment does not really intimidate me in any way. As I said, I am an umpire and being an umpire, I meet a lot of people every game and deal with A LOT of (let's say "trash") thrown my way from coaches and parents. It is a great thing to know that I will be working with calm, intelligent individuals throughout this whole camp.
