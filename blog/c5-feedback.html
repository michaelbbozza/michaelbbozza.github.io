  <h1>To pair, or not to pair; That is the question</h1>

    Pairing is always encouraged. When you pair with others, you give yourself a "surface" to bounce your ideas off of. Working by yourself is good, but only to a point. If you are working by yourself and get stuck on a topic or line of code, there is only so much you can do before you start going crazy talking to yourself. This is where a second person comes into play. It allows you to see the situation from a different point of view, because not everyone thinks the same or sees things the same.

    Pairing with others to solve challenges is normally a fun and rewarding task. You may make a new friend, or better yet, they may teach you something that you do not know or help you get through the task that you are stuck on. This is very helpful when something is frustrating or difficult, especially if your pairing partner is knowledgeable in the topic or language you are using.

    When I read my feedback, I felt pretty good about some of the opinions that others have of me. Getting feedback from others is helpful because it allows me to get an idea of what I need to improve on. Based on my feedback, I definitely need to improve on most of my Ruby commands and methods, as well as be a little more creative with CSS.

    Writing feedback on others was pretty easy but also kind of nerve-racking. It's hard to put into words sometimes. Overall, my partners were very knowledgeable and helped me progress further in my programming skills due to their helpfulness and knowledge. The most difficult thing to do when writing my feedback was to correctly portray the way our pair session went. There were times that I wrote feedback and realized I didn't touch upon the pairing session at all or didn't give any constructive criticism (if there was any). The hardest thing was including all of the points I had wanted to include in the feedback, from the good points to the bad.

    Getting feedback and pairing with others is definitely a big help in the learning process. Feedback allows you to see what others can see, even if feedback is not entirely good. Feedback can show you a different perspective of your skills and show you what you need to work on and what you have down perfectly. Pairing is extremely helpful in the learning process because it gives you a person to bounce ideas off of and get second opinions or different perspectives on subjects. Overall, pairing and feedback are very helpful in the learning process and can be very enjoyable as well.
