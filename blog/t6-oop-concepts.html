  <h1>Fight of the Century</h1>
  <h2>Classes VS Modules</h2>
  <h4>Match 31, 2015</h4>
  <h2>In This Corner, Classes!</h2>
  <p>
    Weighing in as an easily manipulated object, we have Classes! Classes are (for lack of a better description) "mini-modules". One huge difference between classes and modules, however, is that classes can create an infinite amount of objects without interfering with one another. In classes, you can create different types of variables, whether they are class variables, local variables, or instance variables, that can be manipulated throughout the programming in the class. However, a variables discussion will be saved for a later time and new blog, but for now, just know that variables can be defined in classes, and some can be manipulated and used throughout the class and produce different results, while not interfering with each other.

  <h2>And In This Corner, Modules!</h2>
  <p>
    Weighing in as what you assign to it, we have Modules! Modules are very similar to hashes. Modules are defined with a key and a given value. This means that modules are primarily static, and do not change like classes can. When a key (let's say "car") has a given value (let's say "Mercedes"), that is what it is. When you call the module and tell it to search for the key "car", it will return "Mercedes", no ifs, ands, or buts about it.

  <h2>Ding!! Ding!! Ding!!</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, both methods can be used for different reasons. Personally, I enjoy using classes as the values of your variables can be manipulated to create as many as you want with each one being different. Modules are similar to hashes, which are static and do not allow for much manipulation.
