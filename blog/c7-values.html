  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    I remember playing baseball when I was younger. I've played for a long time, but this story refers specifically to when I was about 12 years old, pitching in the Williamsport league. Bases were loaded, nobody out, we were up by one run; perfect pitching scenario. My coach called time and brought me in to pitch. Most of my values and characteristics revolve around being calm under pressure and maintaining composure. I can also use intellect and decisiveness to (in this case) fool the batters. I try to constantly portray these values and live up to them. Maintaining composure and keeping your calm under pressure are two very important values in today's world, as you never what may be thrown your way and what difficulties/pressure you may encounter. Intellect and decisiveness are also important in the same aspect, but without maintaining composure or staying calm under fire, you may not be able to portray your intellect or decisiveness because you are verklempt(overcome with emotion). This can drastically change the outcome of a situation due to panicked decisions.

    After warming up, the game resumed play. Just to reiterate the situation, bases were loaded, nobody out, and we were up by one run. I am now on the mound. Looking at the batter, I tried to remember what he had done in the game so far and use that to my advantage. Even though the bases were loaded, I felt absolutely no pressure with the tying run on third base. I remembered that the batter couldn't hit too good, so I pitched him in difficult spots to hit and struck him out. Now we have one out. Next batter was a kid that hit a double earlier in the game on a high pitch. I decided to slow down the pitches and throw them low inside, a very hard pitch to hit in fair territory because batters are out in front of it due to expecting a fastball. Now I have 2 strikes on him, with one out, and only need a double play to get out of the inning. I pitch a fastball low, he hits a groundball. Now to pause the story. If I did not have any intellect or decisiveness, I would not have known how to strike out the first batter and which pitches I should throw to make this batter hit a groundball. Also, if I could not keep my composure under pressure, this situation could have turned out chaotically.

      The groundball heads right towards me, which is perfect. I field the ball and toss it to the catcher at home to prevent the tying run from scoring. The catcher then threw the ball to first for the double play. It was like a major league game. We got the three outs and won the game. My coach told me after the game that he noticed my composure when I was on the mound and that is why he chose me to get us out of the situation. He knew that I would be able to stay mentally stable and get the three outs and win the game for us. Thanks to my values, I was able to get us out of the inning unscathed. This holds true for many things I encounter nowadays. Whether it is programming, working, playing video games, dealing with family issues, I am known to keep my cool and not panic and make irresponsible decisions.

      A lot of times, my friends will ask me for advice on something that is going on in there lives. Most of the time I am able to help, but I am only human and can't always help. My friends know me as keeping my cool as well. I've had my times where I lost my cool (as a kid) and remember the outcomes not being so good, causing the adult me to constantly keep my cool and not let anything affect my decisiveness and thought process. I think that my values can significantly help any situation due to cool headed thinking and thought processing, as opposed to frantic and panicked responses. Another thing that is very good to do is take a walk or get away from a problem is possible. One of my teachers once told me "If you look at a problem for too long, it begins to look correct." This definitely holds true for almost any problem that you will encounter, especially if it's writing code or arguing with someone. Just take a deep breath, take a walk, and come back to it at another time (when you have calmed down and have regained your composure). This will certainly help with solving issues.
