  <h1>21 Questions</h1>
  <h2>What Are Good Questions?</h2>
  <h4>April 20, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    What is considered a good (or smart) question? One way to be sure that you are asking a good question is to write out the question and then walk away from it for 5-10 minutes and stop thinking about it. This also works when you are frustrated. But the reason for this is that it will help clear your mind of the frustration and the confusion that you are experiencing at that moment. After your "question break", go back and read your question. Does it make sense to you? Are you able to understand what the question is specifically asking? If someone asked you the question, would you know exactly what they are asking? These are just a few examples of things to ask yourself, before asking a "bad" question. Now while no question is specifically "bad", there are "bad" ways to ask them. These can be determined by the previous questions I had mentioned. If any one of those three questions receives a "No" as an answer, then it may need to be rewritten in a way that answers "Yes" to all three questions.

    This isn't a 100% fool-proof strategy or by any means saying that every question can be modified to answer all three, but it is a good place to start. This method and "guidelines" will (for the most part) ensure a full, complete, and helpful answer to your original question. Some examples of bad questions are questions that are possibly written in a strange way that makes it hard to understand. Another example could be a question that has a very broad answer to it, or if a question doesn't specifically specify the subject it is about. Be sure to ask fully detailed and specific questions to ensure a more specific and helpful answer from the responder(s). To ask a good question, be sure to leave out the tiny details that are unnecessary. This sometimes makes it more difficult to troubleshoot the issue (let's say in coding) or reproduce/understand the issue (in almost everything else). If you cannot understand what the question is asking, or provide too many little details that confuse a responder, then you may receive responses that have nothing to do with your question.

    So let's review, to ask a good question, you should: <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Write down your question and take a short break.</li>
      <li>Come back to your question and read it.</li>
      <li>Ask yourself 3 questions:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Does it make sense?</li>
          <li>Are you able to understand what the question is specifically asking?</li>
          <li>If someone asked you the question, would you know exactly what they are asking?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you can answer all three of these questions with a "Yes" without modifying the wording of the question, then you are all set to push "Enter" and post it to begin receiving answers! I hope this has a big help in understanding the difference between good and bad questions.
