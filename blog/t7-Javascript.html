  <h2>Variables in JavaScript and Ruby</h2>
  <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    Variables are used in almost every programming language. This blog will discuss some of the differences between variables in JavaScript and Ruby. To begin, variables are used to store information about an 'identifier'. If the variable refers to a long number, such as Pi (3.14...), then you can name the variable "Pi" and equal it to 3.14. Now, instead of entering "3.14" everytime in your programming, you can enter the variable name "Pi". This makes it easier to remember certain values when programming. This can increase efficiency and productivity.

  <h2>Ruby Variables</h2>
  <p>
    Variables in Ruby (depending on their scope) can be either local, global, instance, or class. In this explanation, we will focus on all variables as a whole (so some info may not be completely correct depending on the type of variable you reference). Ruby variables can be passed to a method with the same variable name without changing the value of the variable. This makes Ruby variables more "firm" or "stable" than JavaScript variables. Most of the time (as I said, depending on scope), Ruby variables cannot be accessed between methods or classes. But overall, the main thing about Ruby variables is that they are mainly "static" or "stable" and do not normally change values unless specifically programmed to do so.
  </p>
  <h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript variables, on the other hand, are easily changeable, sometimes making programming difficult because you have to be absolutely careful about how you label the variable or write code so that you do not change the value of the variable when it is unintended. Whenever you use a variable, the value has the potential to change. If you create a variable, and then pass it through a function, the variable will most likely change its value. This can cause some serious issues when developing applications. You may end up with a value or answer that you are not expecting to get. To counteract this issue, the programmer needs to create a <b>fixed</b> variable, otherwise the value of the variable will change whenever the variable is called with a different value.
