  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h2>White Men Can't Jump</h2>
  <h4>March 31, 2015</h4>

  <p>
    Stereotype threat refers to a common stereotype hindering the ability of an individual, due to the stereotype. Dr. Claude Steele wrote a book called "Whistling Vivaldi". In the book, he states that one of the biggest barriers for people is the "stereotype threat", which is when an individual or group is being viewed through a negative scope or is afraid that what they do may actually confirm the stereotype. The example given on Wikipedia is that an African American will score lower on their SATs because African Americans are stereotyped as less intelligent. Personally, I do not believe in Stereotype Threat and have good reason. Look at the title of this blog. White men can't jump. When I was in high school, we had to do the long jump for gym class. We'd get a running start and then jump before we got to the line, and land in a pile of sand. The teacher would measure it and mark the landing spot and write down the distance.

    Now I had a lot of African Americans in my gym class (which broke an African American stereotype in itself because I went to a private school). All of the African American kids were bragging about how they can jump x amount of feet. Meanwhile, I jumped the furthest out of EVERYONE in my class. Now tell me, if the stereotype is that "white men can't jump", then why did I jump the furthest? I didn't let a stupid stereotype (and movie title) hinder my athletic ability. It's like people say, words can't hurt you. So why let some stereotype, created years ago, hinder your ability? There is no reason for letting something (that was thought up a long time ago and not referring to modern culture) bother you and degrade you? As I stated in the last paragraph, I do not believe in stereotype threat. I believe that this whole concept of "stereotype threat" has been contrived as an excuse for why a person fails, instead of just accepting the fact that they failed and learn from the failure. And better yet, if you're going to use "stereotype threat" as an excuse, try overcoming the stereotype (like I did in gym class) and proving everyone wrong. Eventually, the stereotype will disappear due to the amount of inaccuracies that have occurred because you overcame the so called "stereotype threat".

    Now, you may think this is a harsh blog, but it is not. I do not have anything against other races and certainly do not believe in stereotypes as anything can happen. We are all humans, regardless of color, size, or gender. I also do not want to cause debate over this topic or portray an image of myself that is not true. I do not see the world in different colors, only gray. We are all the same and can accomplish anything. Stereotypes are not right and certainly should not hinder a person's ability because of a stereotype. The best thing to do (other than continue spreading stereotypes against other races) is to ignore the stereotypes and achieve your greatest potential.
